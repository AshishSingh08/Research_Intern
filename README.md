Machine Learning-Driven Drug Classification: Leveraging Mechanisms of Action for Drug Discovery &amp; Medication Recommendations

To run Flask-based Drug Mechanism of Action prediction app, follow these steps-:
1) Go to Mechanism-of-Action folder, then to flask folder in git bash terminal. then run python script app using    [python app.py]
2) The app will start at localhost. Upload the test dataset named as 'test_features.csv' present under the same folder 'Flask'. Click on predict button.
3) The prediction results will be displayed along with supporting tables and graphs.

To run Disease diagnosis and medication recommendation app, follow these steps-:
1) Go to Mechanism-of-Action folder, then to diagnostics_and_medications folder.
2) Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3) Run the application using python app.py.
4) The application will get started. Now enter the details like name, age, alcohol intake status, pregnancy staus, etc. Then select the symptoms from given list and click on predict.
5) The possible diseases will get displayed along with their corresponding probabilities. Now click on get medication button. Enter the duration of symptoms.
6) The medication will also be dispalyed along with necessary precautions to be taken.
